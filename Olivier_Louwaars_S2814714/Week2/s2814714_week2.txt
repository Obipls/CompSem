Hard concepts in text:
1:	First, let M = (D, F ) be a model, let g be an assignment in M , and
	let τ be a term. Then the interpretation of τ with respect to M and
	g is F (τ ) if τ is a constant, and g(τ ) if τ is a variable. We denote the
	interpretation of τ by I F g (τ ).
Too many variables at once, oversight lost

2:	¬∃x(inanimate(x)∧talk(x)).
	Once again, instead of making use of a special sort of variable that is
	restricted in its interpretation, we have made use of an extra unary
	relation symbol (here, inanimate) which we insist be interpreted by
	the individuals in the relevant sort.
Context is missing, who are the individuals, and of what sort are they?


1.1.5:
1: ∃xhappy(x) → happy(Vincent)
2: ∃xhappy(x) ∧ ¬happy(Vincent) → happy(Jules) ∨ happy(Butch)
3: ∀xhappy(x) v (fighting(Butch) ∧ (fighting(Pumpkin)) v weirdExperience(Vincent)
4: ∃x(damaged(x)) ∧ ∃y(bulletholes(y)) ∧ damaged(Car) ∧ bulletholes(Wall)
5: ∀x,y(tasty(x) ∧ good(y)) ∧ ∃z(excellent(z)) ∧ tasty(Hamburgers) ∧ good(Fries) ∧ excellent(Milkshakes)
6: ∀xpeopleInBasement(x) ∧ xwearing(y) ∧  wearing(leatherJacket v dogCollar)
