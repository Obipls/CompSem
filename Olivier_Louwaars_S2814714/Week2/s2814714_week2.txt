Hard concepts in text:
1:	First, let M = (D, F ) be a model, let g be an assignment in M , and
	let τ be a term. Then the interpretation of τ with respect to M and
	g is F (τ ) if τ is a constant, and g(τ ) if τ is a variable. We denote the
	interpretation of τ by I F g (τ ).
Too many variables at once, oversight lost

2:	¬∃x(inanimate(x)∧talk(x)).
	Once again, instead of making use of a special sort of variable that is
	restricted in its interpretation, we have made use of an extra unary
	relation symbol (here, inanimate) which we insist be interpreted by
	the individuals in the relevant sort.
Context is missing, who are the individuals, and of what sort are they?


1.1.5:
1: ∃xhappy(x) → happy(Vincent)
2: ∃xhappy(x) ∧ ¬happy(Vincent) → happy(Jules) ∨ happy(Butch)
3: ∀xhappy(x) v (fighting(Butch) ∧ (fighting(Pumpkin)) v weirdExperience(Vincent)
4: ∃x(damaged(x)) ∧ ∃y(bulletholes(y)) ∧ damaged(Car) ∧ bulletholes(Wall)
5: ∀x,y(tasty(x) ∧ good(y)) ∧ ∃z(excellent(z)) ∧ tasty(Hamburgers) ∧ good(Fries) ∧ excellent(Milkshakes)
6: ∀xpeopleInBasement(x) → xwearing(y) ∧  wearing(leatherJacket v dogCollar)

1.1.7:
1: Free: y
2: Free: x,y
3: Free: x,y,y
4: Free: x, Bound: y,y
5: Bound: w,y,y

1.1.10:
1: True
2: True
3: True

1.1.11:
M = (D,F)
D = {d1,d2,d3,d4,d5}
F (Vincent) = d1
F (Butch) = d4
F (Jules) = d5
F (Aggressive) = {d1,d5}
f (Motorbike) = {d3}
F (Gun) = {d2}
F (Has) = {(d1,d2),(d4,d3)}.



4: A modelchecking tool should at least work by the following rules:
- Is the model defined with the correct domain?
- Are all open brackets (curly, square, parentheses) also closed?
- Does every line end with a comma, and the last one with a period?
- Does every relation start on a new line?
- Does the arity of every relation correspond to the given value?
- Is there a WordNet entity for every synset?
- Is every individual in a relation defined in the domain?
- Does every individual with a adjective synset also have a noun synset?
- Are the synsets formatted correctly with underscores?
